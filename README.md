The CheckMyPlant website requires users to register an account to access its services. After registering and signing in, users can upload a photo of a plant to be detected and view the results. 

The results page displays consumer or plant producer information, and users can return to the upload picture page or complete an optional survey. 

After submitting the survey, the user is redirected to the upload picture page.
